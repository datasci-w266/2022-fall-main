Then the diagonal matrix $D$ scales each element of $\\mathbf{v_i}$, and we again rotate the resulting vector $D \\mathbf{v_i}$ by the matrix $U$.\n",

    "Why is this useful? In NLP, we'll often find ourselves dealing with \"one-hot vectors\" that look like the test vectors $\\mathbf{\\hat{e}_i}$, often with each $i$ representing a particular word. Then the rows of $U$ or $V$ can be used as **representations** (or \"**embeddings**\") of these words into a more interesting vector space. Later in the course, we'll explore the properties of these embedding spaces, and build on them to construct neural network models for language."
