* [answers](answers) file where you'll put all your answers (except D5)



## Submission Instructions

This assignment does **not** require you to use a Colab notebook. You can run it all on your GCP instance and then use the submit.sh script to submit your work. As a result you do **not** need to run scp to copy notebooks this time.

As with Assignment 3, please submit by running the submit.sh script, only with `-a 4` (since this is assignment 4).
```
./assignment/submit.sh -u your-github-username -a 4
```

It is your responsibility to check that your work has made it to your GitHub repository in the `a4-submit` branch.  As always, a small number of points will be added for submitting correctly.  We will give each person who correctly submits their assignment one bonus point on this homework assignment.
