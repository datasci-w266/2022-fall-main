## Do not modify the format of this file.
#  (If you are curious, it is YAML format which lets us efficiently get everyone's answers
#   in one central spreadsheet so we can quickly grade them.)

## The goal of this file is twofold:
#  1.  Allow us to line up the GitHub repository with our enrollment data from UC Berkeley.
#  2.  Allow us to spend our first live session talking about neural networks instead of
#      course policy, while still being confident everyone has read the syllabus.

# Replace the next two lines with your name.
last_name: Lastname
first_name: FirstName

# Replace the next line with your Berkeley email address.
# We use it to give you access to the grading sheet.  It *must* be @berkeley.edu.
# See the assignment instructions on how to get one if you don't have one already!

# 15. "But I really wanted to say something more nuanced on the previous question!"
#     Here's your chance!
