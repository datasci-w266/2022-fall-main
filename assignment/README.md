### Assignments

You should begin working on assignments as soon as they are released.

Each assignment is due at 11:59pm Pacific on Sundays, unless otherwise stated.

You do not need any resources outside the class to do the assignments.  If
you are stuck, please reach out on Piazza!

### Weighting

Assignments are weighted equally.

### Collaboration policy

The work you submit must be your own. You are permitted to discuss the 
assignment at a high level with other students, but you should not share code, 
implementation details, or specific solutions.

More specifically:
- You may collaborate verbally with other students, but you should not look at 
  or help debug each other's code.
- You can get help on general programming issues, but only in a very general 
  capacity that does not relate to a specific part of the assignment. (example: 
  "Oh, I had issues with that function crashing, but updating TensorFlow to 1.14 
  fixed it for me.") If in doubt, ask in a *private* question on Piazza.
- You should not search for or use solutions to the assignment problems that you 
  find on the web. If you inadvertently come across such a solution, you 
  **must** cite it appropriately in your answer. (Bad search: "how to implement 
  GloVe in TensorFlow". Good search: "how to use `tf.variable_scope`" or "how to 
  concatenate matrices")
- You should not use external libraries to shortcut parts of the assignment. The 
  libraries imported in the starter code should be more than sufficient, 
  although you're welcome to use standard Python libraries like `pdb` or 
  `itertools` if you desire.

## Work in git!

Please do your work in a `git` repository; you can simply clone the course repo 
to get started. If there are any updates or fixes to the assignment, we'll 
update the master repo and you can patch your client with `git pull`.  Be sure
to use the assignment submit script (see Assignment 0 for instructions) to submit.
**Do not** make pull requests on the course repo!

Be sure to **`submit.sh`** often to save your work!
