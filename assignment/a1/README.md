# Assignment 1: Neural Networks

This assignment consists of two notebooks:
* [NNBasics](NNBasics.ipynb), Neural Network Basics in NumPy
* [TensorFlow](TensorFlow.ipynb), in which we'll train our first deep neural network with TensorFlow / Keras
* [answers](answers) file where you'll put all your answers

You may want to review the notebook for [lesson 1](../../materials/lesson_notebooks/lesson_1_NN_Review.ipynb).

## Submission Instructions

As with Assignment 0, please submit by running the submit script, only with -a 1 (since this is assignment 1).
```
./assignment/submit.sh -u your-github-username -a 1
```

It is your responsibility to check that your work has made it to your GitHub repository in the a1-submit branch.  As always, a small number of points will be given in each assignment for submitting in the right place.  We will give each person who correctly submits their assignment one bonus point on this homework assignment.

It will be tempting, if you are familiar with Git, to do something more complicated.  Try to resist.  The only step in the submission process is to run the submit.sh command.  Don't send pull requests, don't merge to master, don't git merge.  Just commit to your local repo and run the submit.sh command.  If you want to get yourself into a weird state despite this warning, please at least take the time to read and understand the contents of the submit.sh script above!
